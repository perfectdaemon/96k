# 96k
96 kilobytes game written on C++. At least, just an engine for it.

Based on core of [harsh](https://github.com/XProger/harsh) game engine by XProger

Ready:
* Render core (Buffers, Shader, Texture, Material)
* Scene core (Node, Camera)
* 2D Sprites
* Font - load from file, render
* tga, bmp support
* cheetah texture atlas support

To do: 
* Deal with file packs (rewrite it probably, sorry X 8) )
* Sound (ufmod + something else)
* input system (analyze or rewrite)
